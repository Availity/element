## Upgrading to Element v1

Element v1 introduces a major upgrade to Material UI v6. This guide outlines
the breaking changes and provides migration tools to ensure a smooth
transition. We've developed custom codemods based on Material UI's
official migration tools to automate many of the required changes. For a
comporehensive list of the changes made in MUI v6 see
[Material UI's Upgrade to v6 Guide](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v6/).

### Critical Changes

These changes will more than likely affect your application:

#### Grid Component Updates

- **Size Props**: Renamed the `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl` props to unified size prop

- **Offset Props**: Renamed the `xsOffset`, `smOffset`, `mdOffset`, `lgOffset`, and `xlOffset` props to unified offset prop

Use this codemod to migrate to the new props:

```bash
npx @availity/mui-codemod@latest v1.0.0/grid-v2-props <path/to/folder>
```

To migrate manually, see [Material UI's documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v6/#grid2).

### Potential Impact Changes

These changes may affect your application depending on component usage:

#### Component-Specific Changes

- [Accordion](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v6/#accordion)

  - Summary wrapped in an `h3` heading element
  - Summary as a button html structure changes

- [Autocomplete](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v6/#autocomplete)

  - Modified `onInputChange` callback behavior

- [Chip](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v6/#chip)

  - Updated focus handling mechanics

- [Divider](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v6/#divider)

  - Changed vertical orientation to a `<div>`

- [Grid](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v6/#grid2)

  - Removed `disableEqualOverflow` prop

  - Modified item spacing behavior

- [Typography](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v6/#typography)

  - Removed color prop

#### Non-Impact Changes

The following changes should not require any action:

- [Removal of UMD bundle](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v6/#umd-bundle-removed)

- [Grid2 unstable prefix removal](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v6/#grid2)

- [Button loading state removed from Lab](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v6/#button-with-loading-state)

- [ListItem deprecated props removal](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v6/#listitem)

- [useMediaQuery type modifications](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/upgrade-to-v6/#usemediaquery-types)

### Optional Future-Proofing

Material UI v6 deprecates system props in the `Box`, `Typography`, `Link`,
`Grid`, `Stack` components. Deprecated props include: `mt`, `bgcolor`, and
similar styling props. While not required for Element v1, early migration
can be done via codemod:

```bash
npx @availity/mui-codemod@latest v1.0.0/system-props <path/to/folder>
```
