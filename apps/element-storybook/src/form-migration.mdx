# Form Migration

For the `@availity/element` components, we have chosen to move away from
`formik` in favor of `react-hook-form`. For exiting forms utilizing
`@availity/react` and `formik`, some refactor is required.

## Why `react-hook-form`?

After a successful internal implementation of an extremely long and
complicated form using `react-hook-form`, we decided to move forward with
it. `react-hook-form` is very lightweight and flexible. It also boasts a
large community and is actively and regularly supported.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-hook-form
```

OR

```sh
yarn add react-hook-form
```

## Usage

At the moment, @availity/element does not export a `<Form />` component.
Instead, use the native `<form>` element. You can then use `react-hook-form`'s
`useForm` hook to manage your form.

You can find some examples [here](/docs/layouts-form--docs).
