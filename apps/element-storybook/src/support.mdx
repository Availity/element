## Releases and Long Term Support Schedule

Element is built on top of `@mui/material` and it's corresponding libraries. Our release and LTS schedule
follows their schedules to ensure the latest updates as they're made available.

Material has updated their [release/support schedule](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/support/#long-term-support-lts)
to allow for a yearly major release around the end of Q1 with long term support for the previous major release,
dropping support for the version that falls 2 majors behind the current.

As Material drops support for a major version, we will also be dropping support for the corresponding
version of Element.

### Element Schedule

- Current version: Released yearly in Q2 following new MUI major release
- Previous version: Long Term Support corresponding with support of MUI version
  - There will be a gap where the previous MUI version will be unsupported before a new Element version is released,
  resulting in only the current version of Element being supported from end of Q1 to our release of the next major in Q2.
- 2+ Major versions behind Current: Unsupported

#### Support Status

| Element Version | MUI Version | Status | EOL Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| ^2.0.0 | ^7.0.0 | ✅ Full Support | March 2027 (proj) |
| ^1.0.0 | ^6.0.0 | ⚠️ LTS | March 2026 (proj) |
| ^0.0.0 | ^5.0.0 | 🚫 Unsupported | August 2024 |

#### Element Version 1 & 2 Caveats

MUI updated their release schedule starting with v6. While originally planning on 2 major versions a year, they have scaled it
back to only one major release a year and supporting 1 previous major version. As such, v6 was released in August 2024 but
will likely lose support in March 2026, about 6 months shy of the typical 2 year support schedule.

This means version 1 of Element will also be losing support in March 2026 and version 2 in March 2027, but future versions
should have the full 22 months of support.
