import { Meta } from '@storybook/addon-docs';
import { Badge, Chip, MailIcon, ThemeProvider } from '@availity/element';

## Installation

To install the library in your project, you can use either NPM or Yarn:

```sh
npm install @availity/element
```

OR

```sh
yarn add @availity/element
```

## Usage

The [@availity/element](https://availity.github.io/element/?path=/docs/element--docs) package contains all of the components and hooks for the design system. We recommend using this package when you want to use multiple components.

To use the components in your project, you will need to import them first:

```tsx
import { Button, ThemeProvider } from '@availity/element';
```

Make sure all of the components you use are inside the `ThemeProvider` component. We recommend placing it in your root `index.{js|tsx}` file.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@availity/element';

const App = () => {
  return <ThemeProvider>{/* Application code. Most likely a router. */}</ThemeProvider>;
};
```

## Pattern Differences

### Composition and Custom Components

There are a few gotchas when creating components. This is a brief overview taken from the [Mui Composition Docs](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/composition). Visit the Mui docs for more details and code examples.

- Refs (most common issue so far)
  - When using a custom component for `children` or `component` make sure it can take a ref. This means for function components to wrap it in a `forwardRef`.
- Wrapping Components that have `muiName` property
  - If you're wrapping a component that has the `muiName` property, be sure to also assign it to the wrapped component.
- Using the `component` property to replace the root element
  - avoid inline functions and pass a static component instead
  - be aware of prop name collisions when prop forwarding
  - with Typescript: the type of the props should be used with type arguments

### Common Props

- `tag`: While Reactstrap uses `tag` to change the root element, Mui uses `component`. See [Composition](#composition-and-custom-components) notes above.
- `pill`/`outline`/etc: Different styling variations are now contained within the `variant` prop.

### Component Equivalents

Not all classes/components from Bootstrap/Reactstrap have a similar name or 1:1 equivalent in MUI. Listed below are some notable changes

| Bootstrap           | MUI     | Description                          | Example Use |                                                          Sample                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------- | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| `Badge`<sup>1</sup> | `Badge` | Small corner overlay of base element | Counters    | <ThemeProvider><Badge color="primary" badgeContent='5' variant="dot"><MailIcon fontSize="large"/></Badge></ThemeProvider> |
| `Badge`<sup>2</sup> | `Chip`  | Inline colored label/descriptor      | Status      |                   <ThemeProvider><Chip color="warning" label="Pending" size="small" /></ThemeProvider>                    |
