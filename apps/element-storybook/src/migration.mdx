## Installation

To install the library in your project, you can use either NPM or Yarn:

```sh
npm install @availity/element
```

OR

```sh
yarn add @availity/element
```

## Usage

The [@availity/element](./packages/element/) package contains all of the components and hooks for the design system. We recommend using this package when you want to use multiple components.

To use the components in your project, you will need to import them first:

```tsx
import { Button, ThemeProvider } from '@availity/element';
```

Make sure all of the components you use are inside the `ThemeProvider` component. We recommend placing it in your root `index.{js|tsx}` file.

```jsx
import { ThemePovider } from '@availity/element';

const App = () => {
  return <ThemeProvider>{/* Application code. Most likely a router. */}</ThemeProvider>;
};
```
