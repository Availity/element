# What is `@availity/element`?

The vision behind `@availity/element` is to build a wholistic design system
rather than simply a collection of components. The components are built in
collaboration with the UX team and based on larger patterns. This helps
create a cohesive experience across applications and frees up developers to
focus on rapid innovation.

## Why MUI?

Basing `@availity/element` on MUI allows us to streamline processes across
the development cycle.

- MUI integrates with Figma enabling UX to quickly produce designs that
  closely match the actual components.

- MUI's components allow for greater flexibility and less abstraction.
  This enables developers to focus on business logic and innovation rather
  than component limitations.

- MUI handles a lot of baseline accessibility logic such as tab and
  keyboard interactions.

- MUI's theming engine makes it easy to implement global updates to the
  look and feel.

## Current State

The goals of the current version of `@availity/element` include building a
cohesive design system with an eye on easing the migration process. The
initial release will provide a solid path towards 508 compliance and
baseline component-level telemetry.

## Future Plans

In upcoming versions of the design system, internationalization will be a
focus.
