 * The internal `useAuthorize` hook utilizes [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/react/overview) to handle data fetching.
 * This means you must add a [QueryClientProvider](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/react/reference/QueryClientProvider)
 * to your app if you do not already have one.
 *
 * The default setup should cover most use-cases. However, there are 2 query options we recommend looking into
 * in order to determine what is correct for your app. These settings are `refetchOnWindowFocus` and
 * `staleTime`. The first option sets whether the to refetch the query when the window is focused, and
 * the other is the default marker for how long the query is valid.
