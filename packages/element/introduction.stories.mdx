## What is `@availity/element`?

The vision behind `@availity/element` is to build a wholistic design system
rather than simply a collection of components. The components are built in
collaboration with the UX team and based on larger patterns. This helps
create a cohesive experience across applications and frees up developers to
focus on rapid innovation.

## Why MUI?

The official decision process for where Availity would go after Bootstrap 4 started
in 2020. It was decided early on to not upgrade to Bootstrap 5 and instead leave
Bootstrap behind. When determining where to go next the primary contenders were
Material and TailwindCSS. Material is a set of design guidelines started by Google
with an accompanying React component library. TailwindCSS is a "utility-first
CSS framework", with pre-defined classes similar to Bootstrap but going all in
with utility vs the component styles of Bootstrap.

We did POCs for both frameworks in 2021/2022, with Material ultimately coming out
on top for a few reasons:

- MUI integrates with Figma enabling UX to quickly produce designs that
  closely match the actual components.
- MUI's components allow for greater flexibility and less abstraction.
  This enables developers to focus on business logic and innovation rather
  than component limitations.
- MUI handles a lot of baseline accessibility logic for simple components, as
  well as complex accessibility patterns, like keyboard interactions for tabs.
- MUI's theming engine makes it easy to implement global and targeted updates to the
  look and feel.

## Current State

The goals of the current version of `@availity/element` include building a
cohesive design system with an eye on easing the migration process. The
initial release will provide a solid path towards 508 compliance and
baseline component-level telemetry.

## Future Plans

- Internationalization (Material already supports this on the component level)
- Consolidation across Availity Platforms in future themes
