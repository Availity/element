# Upload Migration

The `Upload` component from `@availity/upload` and `@availity/form-upload` has been renamed to the `FileSelector` component. It still uses `@availity/upload-core` package to do the lifting, however, we have renamed, removed, and added some things.

For more in depth component information, visit:

- [Availity Design Documentation](https://design.availity.com/2e36e50c7/p/121639-file-selector)
- [Component Documentation](./?path=/docs/components-file-selector-file-selector--docs)

## Key Differences (not exhaustive list)

### Props

#### ✅ New

- `onDrop`: this prop serves as an `onChange` callback. Use it to get access to the files and the change event
- `disableRemove`: used to prevent removing the file from the list
- `validator`: allows for custom validation
- `customFileRow`: pass in your own component to be used in the FileList
- `queryOptions`: options for the `useQuery` hook

#### ⚠️ Changed

- `max` -> `maxFiles`
- `showFileDrop` -> `enableDropArea`

#### 🚫 Removed

- `onFileUpload`: this prop has been removed in favor of adding `onProgress`, `onSuccess`, and `onError`. Previously, you were required to add these functions yourself. Now they can be passed directly to the component
- `buttonText` (use children prop instead)
- `buttonClassName`
- `dropZoneText`
- `component`

### Form Management

- The FileSelector uses `react-hook-form` instead of `Formik`
- Must wrap component with FormProvider from `react-hook-form`
- The `react-hook-form` provider maintains the state of the selected files. It does not use `@availity/upload-core`.

## Code Examples

`availity-react` Example:

```tsx
import { Upload } from '@availity/form-upload';
import { Form } from '@availity/form';

const UploadForm = () => (
  <Form initialValues={{ fileUpload: [] }} onSubmit={(values) => console.log(values)}>
    <Upload
      name="fileUpload"
      clientId="my-client-id"
      bucketId="my-bucket-id"
      customerId="my-customer-id"
      maxSize={5 * 1024 * 1024}
      multiple={true}
      allowedFileTypes={['.pdf', '.doc', '.docx']}
    />
  </Form>
);
```

`@availity/element` Example:

```tsx
import { FileSelector } from '@availity/mui-file-selector';
import { FormProvider, useForm } from 'react-hook-form';

const UploadForm = () => {
  const methods = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      fileUpload: [],
    },
  });

  const onSubmit = (data) => console.log(data);

  return (
    <FormProvider {...methods}>
      <form onSubmit={methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
        <FileSelector
          name="fileUpload"
          clientId="my-client-id"
          bucketId="my-bucket-id"
          customerId="my-customer-id"
          maxSize={5 * 1024 * 1024}
          maxFiles={5}
          multiple={true}
          allowedFileTypes={['.pdf', '.doc', '.docx']}
        />
      </form>
    </FormProvider>
  );
};
```

## Additional Considerations

### Error Handling

- The new component provides more detailed error feedback
- Errors are displayed using Element Alert components
- Custom error handling can be implemented through the validator prop

### File List Display

- Files are now displayed in a MUI List component
- Can be customized using the customFileRow prop
- Shows upload progress and status more clearly

### Accessibility

- Improved keyboard navigation
- Better screen reader support
- Clear focus indicators
