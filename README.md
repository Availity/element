## FAQ

### How do I add a dependency?

Dependencies can be added to the root `package.json` file using `yarn`. It is not necessary to add a dependency for a specific version. `nx` will handle relating dependencies to the correct packages whenever a package is published.

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

<!-- ## Remote caching

Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster. -->
